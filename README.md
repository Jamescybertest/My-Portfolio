# üõ°Ô∏è My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio a collection of job simulation projects completed through [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/) in collaboration with industry leaders such as **Mastercard**, **Commonwealth Bank**, **Telstra**, and **AIG**.

These real-world exercises allowed me to build and apply key cybersecurity skills, including:

-  **SIEM monitoring** using Splunk  
-  **Incident triage and response**  
-  **Phishing detection and reporting**  
-  **Malware analysis and postmortem reporting**  
-  **Vulnerability assessments and mitigation planning**  
-  **Ethical hacking with Python scripting**  
-  **Web application penetration testing** (HackThisSite challenges)

Each project reflects my dedication to continuous learning and real-world application of cybersecurity skills.  
Feel free to explore the repositories and see what I‚Äôve been working on!
